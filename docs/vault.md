# Media Vault

The Media Vault is a secure, private storage for your saved photos and videos. You can access the vault from the BHTikTok++ settings page or from the quick-launch button on the main feed.

## Features

- **Secure Storage:** Your media is saved to the app's private data folder, so it's not accessible to other apps.
- **In-App Viewer:** View your saved photos and videos in a grid layout.
- **Full-Screen Viewer:** View photos in full screen with swipe navigation and zoom.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter your media by creator, content type, and favorites.
- **Export:** Export your media to the Photos app, either individually or all at once.
